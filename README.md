The Spotify Heroic datasource is the "official" plugin for [Heroic](https://github.com/spotify/heroic)!

It includes:
* Query builder with suggestions for metrics.
* Table support.
* Annotation support.

**Compatible with Grafana versions 6.0 -> 6.5.2**

This plugin is supersedes the previous [Heroic datasource](https://github.com/udoprog/udoprog-heroic-datasource).

Inspiration was taken from the [Grafana InfluxDB plugin](https://github.com/grafana/grafana/tree/master/public/app/plugins/datasource/influxdb).


# Installation

The recommened way to install the plugin is via the official cli:

`grafana-cli plugins install spotify-heroic-datasource`


The plugin can also be installed by directly pointing at a release. Useful if you want to test a feature that hasn't been released yet.

`grafana-cli --pluginUrl https://github.com/spotify/spotify-heroic-datasource/archive/master.zip plugins install spotify-heroic-datasource`


# Local Development

To develop locally:
- `yarn install`
- `yarn watch`

Add the following to your `grafana.ini` to deploy to your local Grafana instance:
```
[plugin.spotify-heroic-datasource]
path = /{path-to-spotify-heroic-datasource}
```

If using Docker, you can mount this repo into the Grafana plugin directory:

```
docker run -it -p 3000:3000 --name=grafana -v `pwd`/dist:/var/lib/grafana/plugins/spotify-heroic-datasource grafana/grafana
```


# Releasing

Travis will automatically bump the patch version of the plugin, tag the commit and make a GitHub Release.

The commit hash then needs to be appended to [repo.json](https://github.com/grafana/grafana-plugin-repository/blob/master/repo.json) in for it to be installable
via the `grafana-cli`.
